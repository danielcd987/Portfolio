Cairn Congregation is a tool for alumni of Cairn University to connect and strengthen relationships between peers. This is my project that I have created for my software engineering class. In this repository there are many files that describe the process of the project. There is a project quote that outlines what the porject will include and how much time was invested into the software. Time sheets which is a report of how much time was put into each aspect of the project. Status reports whihc reflects on the process and if there are any issues that came up during the completuion of the project. Hope you enjoy!
