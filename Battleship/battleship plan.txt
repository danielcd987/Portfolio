Software Development Life cycle (SDLC)

Design/Model --> Analyze (choose best way of handling it.) --> Developing Code (Work Backwards) --> Test (critical!!!

if the test doesnt work then go back to the analyze phase.) --> Implementation (Have the software being used) -->

Maintain (training, fixing bugs) --> Goes back to design and modeling.
