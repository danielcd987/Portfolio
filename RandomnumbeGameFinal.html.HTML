<!--Purpose: the purpose of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge of if and else statements in Javascript. Also shows what skills i have in JS and HTML.
	Description: This is a guess a number game. The console generates a random number between 1 and 25 and the player has to guess it. The webpage will alert you
	if the number is too small, large, or correct. Also the game will alert you when a nonnumber value is inputted-->
	
<!--Also a big thanks to Miguel Tapia who helped me debug the program and clarified concepts i struggled with-->
