        <p>Welcome to my text adventure game! This style of this game is based off a murder mystery.  To play this game you simply type in commands in the text box.
            The web page will alert you if your decision works or not. The map on the webpage is the layout of the house and there are different items to interact with. Hope you enjoy!

            While you are all celebrating in the living room and the power goes out. The power turns back on immedietly and you realize Jeff is gone!!! Everyone begins to panic. 
            In the midst of the panic you find a note on the ground.
